    The <b>common nightingale</b>, <b>rufous nightingale</b> or simply
    <b>nightingale</b> (<em>Luscinia megarhynchos</em>), is a small passerine
    bird best known for its powerful and beautiful song. It was formerly classed
    as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally
    considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It belongs to a
    group of more terrestrial species, often called chats. (From
