# Nightingale

The `common nightingale`, **rufous nightingale** or simply **nightingale** (*Luscinia megarhynchos*), is a small passerine bird best known for its powerful and beautiful song. It was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It belongs to a group of more terrestrial species, often called chats. (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_nightingale))
